        <h4>Dasmoto's Art & Crafts</h4>
        <p>This was the first "off platform" project that I ran into during my Codecademy training. Most of their projects 
          are kept within the website and are led where the off platform projects are very minimally instructed. All that 
          was included for this project was 4 images to include in the site, a "schematic" image showing what colors, fonts, 
          and sizing to use for the text and what the final should look like for comparison. The rest was up to me. Below are 
          snippets of the HTML code, CSS code and what the final website looked like.</p>

        <h4>Basic Java Calculator</h4>   
        <p>This is a simple calculator using Java that performs various mathematical functions based on which method of the
          Calculator class was chosen.</p>
