      <h2 class="project-title" id="Transactional-Function">Transactional Function within Salesforce Org</h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>One of Navy Recruiting Command's (NRC) legacy systems, PRIDE, is a transactional system. This means that throughout the life cycle of an applicant's 
        onboarding journey with the Navy, PRIDE logs it. It keeps a log of when they joined the Navy and what their job, onboarding start date and ship date
        are and any changes that may occur to the applicant or their status like changing of jobs, changing of ship dates or even cancelling their contract
        all together. The problem is with NRC's Salesforce Org, it is NOT transactional like PRIDE is. That means every message PRIDE sends into Salesforce 
        to update an applicant, the previous data is lost. If a job changes, the previous job is lost and same for ship dates. My task was to create a 
        transactional feature within Salesforce to mirror PRIDE</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>At the time, NRC was not utilizing Salesforce's Out-of-the-Box Opportunity object yet. My proposal was to bring in Opportunities since they
          are so closesly tied with Accounts (which NRC uses as Person Accounts to keep applicant records). I made it transactional by utilizing 5 different
          flows, each being a record triggered flow.</p>

              to meet a Status of "Onboarding." It then gathers the necessary information from
              the applicant record and creates an "Onboarding Transaction" record with all the
              necessary information for trends analysis and health of the Delayed Entry Program
              (DEP) analysis.</td>

              changed. When the change happens, however, the record needs to be in Status of 
              "Onboarding" and the previous value of Program and Rate is NOT blank. This flow 
              will capture BOTH the previous value for Program and Rate and the new value entered
              for Program and Rate and enter both of them into a "Reclassification Transaction" record
              along with other metrics used for analysis.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Create Roll-In/Roll-Out Transaction</td>
            <td>This flow is triggered when an Applicant record's Enlisted Ship Date field is 
              changed. When this change happens, however, the record needs to be in a Status of
              "Onboarding" and the previous value of the Enlisted Ship Date field is NOT blank. 
              Once this flow is triggered, it then needs to decide if it will be creating a 
              "Roll-In Transaction" or a "Roll-Out Transaction." This is done by comparing the 
              previous value for Enlisted Ship Date and the new value. If the previous value is 
              greater than the new value, this would indicate an earlier Enlisted Ship Date meaning
              the applicant is "Rolling In." If the previous value is lesser than the new value, this 
              would indicate the applicant is "Rolling Out."

              pertinent data from the Applicant record to create a "Ship 
              Transaction" record for analysis in shipping trends and 
              seats being filled at bootcamp.</td>

              means they decided to quit their contract and not pursue going 
              to bootcamp and becoming a Sailor anymore. This flow will gather 
              necessary Attrite data from the applicant's record and create an 
              "Attrite Transaction" record. Attrite trends are monitored very 
              closely as the the Navy's many fleets can't be manned if Future 
              Sailors don't ship off to bootcamp.</td>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="goaling">Transitioning Goaling into Salesforce Org (Active Project)</h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>This is the first part to a series of transitions that will eventually take the legacy NRC system called WebSTEAM into retirement. The first, and one of the biggest, aspects of this 
        system is tracking the goal assigned to each command. Every Station, known as NRS Name, all the way up to NRC will have a goal assigned to them for each month of the fiscal year. This 
        needs to be brought into Salesforce to present cleanly to top echelon leadership how each command is doing and if NRC will make its assigned goal and missions for the fiscal year.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>I went ahead and created a series of five new custom objects. Those are "NRS Goal", "Division Goal", "NTAG Goal", "Region Goal" and "NRC Goal". Each, as the object name should suggest 
        will track either a station, division, NTAG, region or NRCs goal for any given month. NRS Goal is linked via Master-Detail Relationship to Division Goal, Division Goal is linked via 
        another Master-Detail Relationship to NTAG Goal and NTAG goal is linked by the last Master-Detail Relationship in the chain to Region Goal. Due to the limitation of 3 Master-Detail 
        Relationship links within a chain, I created two Lookup Relationship fields on the NRC Goal object. The first one is labelled "Region East Goal" and the second one "Region West Goal". 
        The NRS Goal record is really the only record that will have the majority of data entered into it when creating a new record. Upon creation, each commands Statistician will have to enter 
        a number for the station's Total Goal, Active Duty goal, Reserve goal, Nuclear contract goal, Special Warfare contract goal and a goal for contracts that got higher than a 50 on the ASVAB. 
        After all of that is inputted, a series of Roll-Up Summary fields on the rest of the objects except for NRC Goal is utilized to calculate that respective records number for that goal. On 
        the NRC Goal object, everything that could NOT be a Roll-Up Summary field was a Formula field instead adding up each field from the "Region East Goal" and "Region West Goal" records. A 
        series of flows is also utilized for this solution to calculate contract attainment and goaling record association.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Assign NRS Goal to Transaction</td>
          <td>This flow is triggered when an Opportunity record is created with a Type equalling either "NCO" or "Attrite". After it's triggered, it will decide on which NRS Goal record 
            to get based on the Type of Opportunity. If it was "NCO", it grabs the the NRS Goal record with the same RSID as the Opportunity record, and the same month and fiscal year as 
            the Onboarding Start Date field. If it was "Attrite", it does the same thing except based on the Attrite Date field. After it gets the necessary data from the Opportunity and 
            NRS Goal records, it updates the correct Opportunity record with the correct NRS Goal record ID to associate the Lookup relationship.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NRS Goal Number Crunch</td>
          <td>This flow, like the last one, is triggered when an Opportunity record is created, however the Type must either be "NCO", "Attrite" or "Reclassification". IT then makes the decision 
            on which NRS Goal record to get based on the Type of Opportunity. If the Type is "NCO", it gets the NRS Goal record based off the RSIDs matching for both records and the month and 
            fiscal year from the Onboarding Start Date field matching the NRS Goal records. Once the record is retrieved, it will add whatever the kind of contract the Opportunity record is with 
            whatever is currently within the Attainment fields on the NRS Goal record. This is done based on a series of IF statements nested with other IF statements, AND statements and OR 
            statements. The next decision branch is based off of the Type "Reclassification" which will match the record based off of RSID and the month and fiscal year of the Transaction Date. 
            The last decision branch is based off of the Type "Attrite" where it compares the RSIDs of both records and the month and fiscal year of the Attrite Date field. This branch is similar 
            to the "NCO" branch except is subtracts numbers instead of adding them. The "Reclassification" branch does both adding and subtracting based on the contract type. After the specific 
            branch has ran, it will take the Record ID from the NRS Goal retrieved and update the Attainment number fields with the variables filled in by the respective formulas.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Same Day Transaction Goal Number Crunch</td>
          <td>This flow is triggered when an Opportunity record is DELETED with a type of "NCO". It will perform pretty much the same function as the "Attrite" branch from the previous flow and 
            subtract whatever contract data necessary from the NRS Goal's Attainment number field. This is important because when a Same Day Transaction occurs, an Attrite Transaction is not 
            created. Instead, that flow actually deletes the NCO Transaction that was previously created minutes before the Attrite message was received by Salesforce.

      <h2 class="project-title" id="Personnel-Record">Personnel Management Integrated into Salesforce Org</h2>
      <!--Insert screenshot of a Personnel Record-->
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>NRC was using an outdated and barely used legacy system to keep track 
        of personnel assigned to Recruiting Command. Since the system was 
        antiquated, NRC requested a Personnel Management functionality be developed 
        within the current Org they operate in.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>Due to some limitations within government contracting and MOUs, my team 
        doesn't usually conduct development using standard objects, except in rare 
        and highly scrutinized occasions. For this project, I built a custom object 
        called "Personnel Records" where we would capture all the required data needed 
        on personnel assigned to Recruiting Command. This wasn't a very intricate project 
        outside of designing the Lightning Page for the object which encapsulates 
        different field visibility based on data within other fields.</p>
        <p>Shortly after demoing this new custom object, there arose another need 
          with this request. Inspection teams required a historical report of where 
          a recruiter was assigned during a certain period of time. This requiest led 
          to the development of a rear facing "PSR History" custom object. Since it's 
          rear facing, users don't have access to the actual object outside of a related 
          list on the "Personnel Record" record. PSR History records are created via 
          a record triggered flow that will capture all the data from a Personnel Record 
          record whenever it's updated or created. This creates a historical feature to 
          the object that helps during investigations and discussions of manning and where 
          place recruiters throughout the nation.</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="on-or-off-production">National NCO Dashboard with On/Off Production Functionality</h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>The point of having a National NCO dashboard is for upper level leadership at NRC 
        Headquarters to be able to have a one stop shop for how commands throughout the nation 
        are doing on achieving their goals. This dashboard breaks it down by command, division 
        and individual recruiter. The problem was with the fact that there was no easy way of 
        getting a recruiter off that dashboard if there was any reason for them to be off production 
        for any period of time. They would have to submit a ticket to get their role and territory 
        elevated to the command level to get them off the dashboard.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>With the development of the "Personnel Record" custom object, there was a picklist field 
          created called "On Production." If the recruiter was on production, the field was marked yes
          and if not, it was marked no. The new National NCO Dashboard's reports were now given a filter
          that the records featured in those reports needed to have their associated Personnel Record as 
          being On Production. With the addition of this filter, now commands simply needed to go into 
          that recruiter's Personnel Record and mark their "On Production" field as no until their return 
          and they were no longer featured on the dashboard.</p>
