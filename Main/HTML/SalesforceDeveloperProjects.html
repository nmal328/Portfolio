      <h2 class="project-title" id="Project-Overview">Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The idea behind this project is to be able to successfully solution through
      the given problems throughout the User Stories. Each User Story is well written
      comes with Acceptance Criteria and specific tests to verify your solution works. 
      This project places you in the shoes of a "new hire" at EventCloud and gives you
      the freedom to take the "clicks not code" approach, or dive into Apex and solution
      through on the "back end". I chose to work through each User Story strictly with 
      Apex Triggers and TriggerHandler classes. Below are the two Triggers I wrote following
      the Trigger Handler Framework Salesforce recommends.</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story1">User Story 1: Initializing Event Status upon Creation</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As an event coordinator,<br>
      I need the system to automatically place a newly created event record into a planning status,<br>
      So that we can start the event organization process with a clear, initial state that indicates 
      the event is in the early stages of planning.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When a new CAMPX__Event__c record is created, the CAMPX__Status__c field should reflect the 
        "Planning" picklist value</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story2">User Story 2: Capturing Event Status Change Timestamp</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As an event coordinator,<br>
        I need the system to automatically capture the current date and time whenever the status of an event changes,<br>
        So that we can have an accurate and automatic record of when each event's status was last modified, helping in 
        timeline tracking and accountability.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When the CAMPX__Status__c field of an CAMPX__Event__c record is edited, the CAMPX__StatusChangeDate__c 
        field should capture the current date and time</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story3">User Story 3: Defaulting Sponsor Status to 'Pending' on Creation</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a sponsorship coordinator,<br>
        I need the system to automatically mark a sponsor as "Pending" if the field is blank upon creation,<br>
        So that we can ensure all sponsors are initially considered for review and categorization, streamlining 
        the sponsorship management process.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When a CAMPX__Sponsor__c record is created, and the CAMPX__Status__c is blank, it should be set to "Pending"</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story4">User Story 4: Enforcing Email Requirements for Sponsor Creation</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a sponsorship coordinator,<br>
        I need the system to prevent the creation of a sponsor without an email,<br>
        So that we can ensure all sponsor records have valid contact information, 
        facilitate communication, and maintain the integrity of our sponsor database.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When a CAMPX__Sponsor__c record is created without a value in CAMPX__Email__c, 
        the user should see an error stating "A sponsor can not be created without an email address"</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story5">User Story 5: Updating Sponsor Tier Based on Contribution Amount</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a event coordinator,<br>
        I need the system to automatically set a sponsor's tier based on their contribution amount,<br>
        So that we can ensure sponsors are recognized appropriately for their contribution level and 
        streamline the sponsorship management process.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>The CAMPX__Tier__c should be set based on the following mapping:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>CAMPX__Tier__c</strong></th>
          <th><strong>CAMPX__ContributionAmount__c</strong></th>

        <tr>
          <td>Null</td>
          <td>CAMPX__ContributionAmount__c is blank</td>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story6">User Story 6: Conditional Sponsor Status Update Based on Event Association</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a sponsorship coordinator,<br>
        I need the system to prevent the status of a sponsor record from being updated to 
        "Accepted" unless it is associated with an event,<br>
        So that we can maintain accurate and meaningful sponsor-event 
        relationships and ensure accepted sponsors are properly linked to specific events.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>The CAMPX__Status__c field of a CAMPX__Sponsor__c record can not be updated to "Accepted" 
        until the CAMPX__Event__c field is populated</p>
      <p>The user should see this error when attempting to accept a sponsor without an event: 
        "A Sponsor must be associated with an event before being Accepted."</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story7">User Story 7: Automatic Update of Net Revenue on Financial Changes</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a financial manager,<br>
          I need the system to automatically update the net revenue of an event record whenever there are 
          changes to its gross revenue or total expenses,<br>
          So that we can ensure real-time accuracy of our financial reporting and provide 
          stakeholders with up-to-date information on the financial status of our events.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>The CAMPX__NetRevenue__c of an CAMPX__Event__c record should always reflect the formula: 
        CAMPX__GrossRevenue__c - CAMPX__TotalExpenses__c</p>
      <p>If either CAMPX__GrossRevenue__c or CAMPX__TotalExpenses__c are blank, the 
        CAMPX__NetRevenue__c should be blank</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story8">User Story 8: Updating Event Gross Revenue upon Sponsor Acceptance</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a finance manager,<br>
        I need the system to automatically keep track of an event's gross revenue by taking a sum 
        of all accepted sponsor's contributions,<br>
        So that we can maintain an accurate and real-time tally of an event's gross 
        revenue and ensure that financial reporting reflects all accepted sponsor contributions.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When a CAMPX__Sponsor__c record is updated to have an "Accepted" CAMPX__Status__c, the 
        system should account for the sponsor's CAMPX__ContributedAmount__c in the CAMPX__Event__c's CAMPX__GrossRevenue__c field</p>

      <h2 class="project-title" id="User-Story9">User Story 9: Adjusting Event Gross Revenue for Cancelled Sponsorships or Event Changes</h2>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a finance manager,<br> 
        I need the system to automatically subtract a sponsor's contribution amount from its associated event's gross 
        revenue when the sponsor is no longer "Accepted" or tied to the event,<br>
        So that our financial records accurately reflect the current status of sponsor contributions and 
        ensure that the event's gross revenue reports are precise and reliable for making informed decisions.</p>
      <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
      <p>When the CAMPX__Status__c of a CAMPX__Sponsor__c changes from "Accepted" to "Cancelled" or "Pending" the 
        associated CAMPX__Event__c's CAMPX__GrossRevenue__c field should no longer reflect the sponsor's CAMPX__ContributedAmount__c</p>
      <p>When the CAMPX__Event__c lookup of a CAMPX__Sponsor__c changes, the previously associated CAMPX__Event__c's CAMPX__GrossRevenue__c 
        field should no longer reflect the sponsor's CAMPX__ContributedAmount__c</p>
